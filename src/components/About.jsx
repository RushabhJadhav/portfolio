                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I have completed my Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and Psychology. During my final year, I discovered coding and was instantly hooked. What started as a personal interest quickly grew into a deep passion for frontend development. My self-taught journey has been fueled by curiosity, determination, and a drive to create seamless, user-friendly web experiences.</p>
                <p>Learning to code has not only transformed my career aspirations but has also taught me the value of continuous learning and problem-solving. I am committed to honing my skills and contributing to projects that make a meaningful impact.</p>
